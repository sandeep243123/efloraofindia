          <h1>Detailed Posting Guidelines</h1>

          <ol>
            <li>
              1. one plant per mail (with preferably three or more pictures from
              different angles along with Close-ups), with different subjects
              only are allowed. Members uploading the photographs for ID should
              ensure that all photographs belong to the same species. Minimum
              date, place, habit and habitat information is required. Members
              providing addition information as given below in the format will
              be appreciated. Follow the following format (without any spacing
              between the lines for easy incorporation in the website) for
              Identification requests/ confirmations, if possible: Date/Time-
              Location- Place, Altitude, GPS- Habitat- Garden/ Urban/ Wild/
              Type- Plant Habit- Tree/ Shrub/ Climber/ Herb- Height/Length-
              Leaves Type/ Shape/ Size- Inflorescence Type/ Size- Flowers Size/
              Colour/ Calyx/ Bracts- Fruits Type/ Shape/ Size Seeds- Other
              Information like Fragrance, Pollinator, Uses etc.- Pl. copy it &
              keep it on desktop in a Word document so that you can copy & paste
              it & fill in the information (& provide pictures for these) to the
              extent possible while requesting for Id. This is compulsory for Id
              requests.
            </li>

            <li>
              2. No restriction of format & number on postings for posting of
              identified plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              3. Please post pictures as attachments, discuss the subjects etc.
              relating to Indian Flora, which is the main focus of this group.
              This is done by sending an e-mail to
              indiantreepix@googlegroups.com. One can add attachment while
              composing the mail. Photographs of well developed leaves, flowers,
              fruits, bark/ stem, full view of the plant etc. & that too from
              different angles including front, side & rear views should be
              posted for correct identification of plants. Avoid posting
              anything which violates copyrights of others. Only individual
              members will be responsible & not the group for any copyright
              violations. Try to furnish the inf. yourself (if possible) or from
              Efloraofindia site by searching for the required species’ page (/)
              or from Wikipedia stating its link or provide suitable other links
              etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              4. Mention the date & place (at least upto state level) of the
              pictures posted. It is useful to add your name and location.
              Please try to identify yourself while posting. Mistakes are
              encouraged over stating nothing, for better learning/
              understanding. No one is infallible.
            </li>
            <li>
              5. Overall size of attachments for posting at a time should be up
              to 7 mb (as per posting restrictions in Google groups). However,
              one can also post more images of total size upto 7 mb each, one by
              one at a time in reply to the original mails. However, minimum
              image size should not be less than 1000 by 800 pixels. Members are
              requested to post as big size as possible in pixels by keeping
              each file size up to say 7 Mb for seeing the details required for
              correct ids.
            </li>
            <li>
              6. Different flowers / plants etc. to be posted in a separate mail
              for better response, linking, avoiding confusion etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              7. Scientific or Common names to be given in the subject as far as
              possible or like “Is this Bombax species?” or “Is it Semal?” etc.
            </li>

            <li>
              8. If you reply to a posting, your message can be sent to the
              whole group (by clicking on ‘Reply to all’) or just to the author
              (by clicking on ‘Reply’). If the reply is only of interest to the
              author or is personal, then use ‘Reply’, otherwise it has to be
              ‘Reply to all’. All members are requested to either ‘Reply’,
              ‘Reply to all’ or ‘Forward’ (Don’t use other methods), so that
              links/ messages/ mails don’t break off. Due to this we are not
              able to link messages properly on Efloraofindia Database along
              with other problems.
            </li>

            <li>
              9. Numbering for Id requests in subject line: Bottomline is that
              there should not be any two posts with the same subject line &
              subject line should be as relevant as possible. Members may follow
              numbering of Id requests like DDMMYY+ Initials+ Sl.No. (if more
              than one on same day) to avoid any confusion, clubbing of mails
              with same subject line on the Google group, better linking in
              Efloraofindia database etc. For example if I post an Id request,
              it will be like ”For Id 060408JM1’’, 060408JM2 etc., in case it is
              not like ”Is it Bombax ceiba (Semal)?” (this is much better &
              recommended). This is to facilitate that no two subject lines are
              same. However, members may follow other methods to ensure that no
              two subject lines are exactly identical. One may post two to three
              Id requests a day for better attention & feedback.
            </li>

            <li>
              10. Members are requested to forward Id. requests/ confirmation
              mails again in case there is no response for about 3 days on the
              group.
            </li>

            <li>
              11. Members are encouraged to write about this group or request
              membership to other e-groups, laymen as well as experts etc. to
              make this group more interesting & responsive. They can join
              directly by clicking (Home page) on
              http://groups.google.co.in/group/indiantreepix?hl=en or sending a
              request to itpmods@googlegroups.com.
            </li>

            <li>
              12. One may announce Tree/ Bird/ Butterfly walks or programmes
              locally or outside etc., availability of pertinent publications,
              software, conferences, launch of new website, important web
              resource – but no commercial advertising is allowed. Photographic
              issues related to Indian Flora are allowed for discussion.
            </li>
            <li>
              13. Giving efloraofindia (efi) site links in the posts: One is
              requested to add efloraofindia (efi) website link (/home) in ones’
              favourites & give species’ links from this while posting or
              replying in a thread as lot of discussed data is already available
              here. This will also help the site move up in search results. One
              can add the efi site home page in ones’ favorites. By writing any
              species in ‘Search this site’ box & clicking, one will find all
              the discussed details & links in the species’ page.
            </li>
            <li>
              14. For adding earlier efloraofindia/ Indiantreepix links, you
              have to go to the home page by clicking at (Efloraofindia website)

              suitable search message - copy the address there & paste it in
